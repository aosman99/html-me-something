  <p>I was born in a country called Somalia. Although<br>
    my family was forced to flee due to war, I will<br>
    always call Somalia home.</p>

    <p>When I was just a few years of age, my family left Somalia. <br/>
       We relocated to Kenya, where we stayed until I was seven years old. <br/>
       Then my family moved to the United States where I have been living ever since.<br/>
       I like to keep my roots so I often visit my family back home. These trips<br/>
       are very humbling and I always return grateful that I am in a position<br/>
       to help my family.

        <p>Fast forward to today. I am a student attending 
           Seattle Central Community College. <br/>
           I am also enrolled in a programming bootcamp with LaunchCode.
           My goal is to land<br/> an internship with 
           LaunchCode while continuing my studies and eventually get 
           my degree in computer science(God willing).
